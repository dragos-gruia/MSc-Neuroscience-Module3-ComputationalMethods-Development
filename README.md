## Introduction

**Module 3 from the MSc in Translational Neuroscience** will introduce you to the most relevant computational methods for the Brain Sciences. It will be divided into 8 days, where each day handles a different thematic and methodology. Each day will consist of workshops and lectures, that start in the morning and end at 5pm. 
      
      Apart from day 1, all the other days will be characterised by a final CHALLENGE. 
      At the end of the first week, you will be randomly assigned one of these challenges, 
      which you have to complete and present in a report, that will be assessed. 
      In the afternoon of each day, you will have the opportunity to start working on 
      the challenge of the day, and ask questions to the TAs in case you have any doubts or problems. 

The general format of each day will be the following: 

1. **Morning**:
    * Introductory lecture 
    * Guided workshop
2. **Afternoon**:
    * Start of potentially assessed challenge (with help of TAs)

**The data for all workshops can be downloaded [here](https://imperiallondon-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/vg816_ic_ac_uk/EhHQbb-ruvFNqZm1a_5XmY8BfzRxYfLnHRGCFW5wq222Kg).**

## Lab experiments

To run the lab experiments, you can use Anaconda, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks), or Google CoLab. 
For more information on how to use Google Colab with GitHub, see this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=-pVhOfzLx9us).<br/><br/> We suggest you to use Jupyter Notebook, and move to Google Colab only if there are significant issues (that cannot be addressed easily) while using Jupyter. For more information on how to use Google Colab with GitHub, see this link.
